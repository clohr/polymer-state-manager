# Polymer State Manager

Simplified fork of [Uniflow](https://github.com/google/uniflow-polymer) along with [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit) to create a simple state management system using behaviors. If you are looking for a more robust state management feature, I would recommend either [Uniflow](https://github.com/google/uniflow-polymer) or [Polymer Redux](https://github.com/tur-nr/polymer-redux). 

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli
    npm i && bower install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:3000` using [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start
