# Polymer State Manager

Used Polymer Starter Kit to create a simple state management system using behaviors.

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

First, install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli
    
### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve -o
